Future Enchancements
We can use the Dow Jones API to get the stock data and also push the data back.
We can build a front end application where we can visualise the data.
Improve security using Oauth and spring-security in future.
Use filters to validate the incoming requests.
We can use a better transaction management approach and rollack policy when inserting data into mongo db.
